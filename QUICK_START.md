4. **Shopify Policies:** Add them BEFORE connecting payment processor
5. **Shipping Expectations:** Always say "7-12 days" (AliExpress Choice average)

## 🚨 Critical Don'ts

- ❌ Don't promise shipping faster than 7 days
- ❌ Don't skip the legal policies (required for payment processing)
- ❌ Don't change the business description (it's bank-optimized)
